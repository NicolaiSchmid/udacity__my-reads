## Hey
This is a project dedicated to managing your book reads.
Spin up the project with `yarn install && yarn start`. Now you can move your books between the topics and add new books, via the plus icon in the corner. Beware, that the search only accepts specific terms, since this is a test project for a Udacity NanoDegree.
